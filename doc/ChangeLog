	* Added top-level-command :more, that will evaluate a form while
	paging the console output. That is, prompt for a key-press after
	each screenful.

2004-07-08  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* Migration to the new basic-vector data-structure is completed
	(though not thoroughly debugged). The los0-gc.lisp example GC is
	updated to reflect this, and now supports any newspace-size upto
	2GB.

2004-04-18  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* The bootloader no longer initializes the VGA subssystem, since
	the textmode driver in los0 should be able to adapt to most
	standard VGA textmodes now.

	* Apropos should work again, I think it didn't before due to a
	compiler bug.

	* There is now a fairly complete GC in los0, meaning in principle
	there us no reason it should not keep running forever. I've had an
	uptime of about a week. The new-space buffer is limited to 256 KB,
	however.

2004-03-29  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* Added basic GC functionality. The Movitz platform is now I
	believe viable for at least some real-world applications!  Also,
	there have been many bug-fixes that I've forgotten to record here.

2004-01-19  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* Fixed the bootloader slightly so it should now work with VMWare.

2004-01-12  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* Fixed the floppy bootloader so that it will work with BIOSes
	whose int13 messes with the GS segment register, like apparently
	the Compaq and some others do.

2004-01-09  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* A disclaimer has been added to the file COPYING.

2004-01-06  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* Rewrote the floppy bootloader so that it is now only limited by
	the size of floppies rather than the previous about 600 KB
	real-mode buffer limit. For some time I've been forced to remove
	some features from los0.img in order to squeeze it into 600 KB,
	but no more. Bloat is bliss. However, booting with GRUB is always
	an option, and probably the best one in the long run, and
	certainly for stable installations (should there ever be
	such). It's just that the floppy loader is very convenient during
	development. [BB-ID: 1680]

2003-12-05  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* Changed the way method dispatches are cached. It used to be
	cached with hash-tables, now it's done with alists. The memory
	usage and lookup-time should be improved for the common case,
	although later on---when we have really big generic-functions---we
	might want to be able to revert to hash-tables. [BB-ID: 1328]

2003-12-03  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* :trace and :untrace are now implemented somewhat differently. In
	particular, :trace takes one function-name, and a keyword argument
	:callers that is a list of function-names, one of which must be
	active (on the current call-stack) for trace to occur.

	* There was a bug in the reporting of how much memory was being
	consumed. That is, room and time would report double the actual
	amounts. So now (time (cons 1 2)) should report 8 bytes.

2003-12-02  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* Added some sort of simple multi-line capability for the
	repl. It's not true multi-line editing, but at least you're not
	limited to one screen-length of input any more.

2003-11-18  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* Improved the style of interfacing hardware registers in the ne2k
	driver. So now the driver is quite a bit smaller, and is again
	included in the los0 image.

2003-11-10  Frode Vatvedt Fjeld  <frodef@cs.uit.no>

	* The last feature I added to eval was lambda the macro and the
	keyword for the function special operator. So now lambda works as
	one expects at the REPL.

	* Started this ChangeLog now, as I hope to distribute Movitz more
	actively. Not that this changelog will mostly be concerned with
	user-visible changes. You can /not/ infer much about the level of
	development activity from looking at this.
